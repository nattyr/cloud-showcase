    <p>Welcome! What you're seeing right now is the end result, the culmination, and the visual facade of a full-fledged
      production ready system. This project deploys a host of AWS infrastructure as well as everything you're seeing via
      a CI/CD pipeline directly to the cloud. <br><br>

      This project's purpose has been to push my skills beyond where I've gone before, and of course - to show you, the
      reader, a portion of my IT skill set. It's been a fun journey for me and I'm excited to show you where it's taken
      me. So, stick around and have a scroll through; and, if you have any feedback, feel free to contact me.</p>

      A deeper explanation of the project and it's working parts. <strong>Coming soon...</strong><br><br>

      In the meantime - please feel free to check out my public <a href="https://github.com/nattyr/cloud-resume">GitHub

    <h1>TODO:</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      One of my main objectives for this project has been to design it with a production ready mind-set, however, I have
      afforded myself some freedoms to best serve my learning process.<br><br>

      Here's my personal list of changes I'm intending to align the project further with what I'd want in a true
      production system:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li><u>Write unit tests for the Python &amp; JavaScript code.</u> The pipeline is
        currently missing unit tests for the Python lambda functions and the JavaScript
        code on the website</li>
      <li><u>Split the Terraform configuration files into logical components.</u> The configuration
        has grown greatly over the course of the ever-expanding scope of this project,
        and is needing some clean restructuring.</li>
      <li><u>Standardise the naming convention for Terraform resource IDs used across
          the project.</u> There's currently an inconsistency in the naming due to my
        styling changing along the way as I increased my familiarisation with Terraform.</li>
      <li><u>Design a solution for managing the IAM role used by the OIDC integration
          with GitHub Actions.</u> The permissions for this role are currently managed
        directly via the AWS console.</li>
    </ol>
